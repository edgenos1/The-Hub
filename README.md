# The Hub

Do you have many resources in your company that you wish to put them in one place and share it with your employees?

**The Hub** is a web application that helps you build ***your Company App Store***. Your employees can browse and pin your resources and access them from their laptop and mobile.

**The Hub** is a simple easy to use web app and, most importantly, will help your employees easily find any link (HR Portal, Finance, Business Apps, forms...etc.) you would like to share with them.

It's also integrated with [Azure Active Directory](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjciN-2hubqAhXFzIUKHVmaC50QFjAJegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Ffundamentals%2Factive-directory-whatis&usg=AOvVaw3Y4jZSujeXwZpUX0VNFYQZ) (other SSO providers supported too with few modifications) to provide a single sign-on experience and can be accessed from [Microsoft Teams](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjVj7DEhubqAhVB1BoKHSgHCBkQFjAAegQIBBAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fmicrosoft-teams%2Fgroup-chat-software&usg=AOvVaw3pgLm_fduw13E3nS-Yxxkk) directly.
